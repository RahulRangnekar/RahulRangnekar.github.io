# Writing

They say writing is therapeutic for the soul. I agree.

Journaling is an opportunity for me to grow into a better person with every word I write. It allows me to dump my thoughts, express unfiltered emotion, track my progress, and analyze myself. It provides thorough introspection by allowing me to have a conversation with myself.

Beyond writing in a personal journal, I enjoy writing publicly on LinkedIn, Medium, and Quora.

These channels allow me to put myself out there. I enjoy others reading, appreciating, and following my posts on LinkedIn, Medium, and Quora. But regardless of the number of likes or claps or upvotes I receive, my greatest reward is the self-confidence I build through writing.

The most meaningful aspect of writing, however, is __helping others__. Whether it is motivating people to overcome obstacles they face, teaching them what I learn through my experiences, or just challenging their beliefs and mine by offering an unconventional point of view, writing connects me with humans from all walks of life.

Writing has helped me grow into a better person, the greatest thing I can do is help others do the same.

Peace and love.
