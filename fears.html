			<p id="proj-description" class="para text-center">This is my final project for UGBA 190T: Creativity Lab. I have focused on my <strong>deepest and darkest fears</strong>. Fear is significant in my daily life. I have relatively minor fears - lifting too heavy of weight at the gym or asking a question in class. And then I have pervasive and lingering fears, listed below. Throughout my junior year of college, I made a conscious effort to acknowledge and assuage them. I examined them at the roots, and dug for the seeds. These stories aren't meant to make you feel bad or sorry for me. These are just elements that shape my life for better or worse. Through this project, I hope to encourage you to acknowledge your fears. Talk about them with others - your friends, your family, even strangers! <strong>We all have our demons</strong>. Most of even have the same ones. But we cannot and <em>should not</em> fight them or stuff them away in our mind. We must befriend them.
			<br><br>
			Through my personal creative channels - graphic design, collage-making, and writing - I impart to you my fears and how I strive to make peace with them.</p>

				<h3>The Roots</h3>
				<p>
				Back in high school, I was in the top 1% of my class. I had straight A's, and was very outgoing in several extracurricular activities. As I entered Cal, I was full of confidence. I was amazing in high school, I could continue in college. 
				<br><br>
				Throughout my first year at Cal, six business organizations rejected me. I struggled in basic, introductory classes. I was lost. It felt as though all my efforts were going to waste. No matter how hard I studied, I couldn't do better in my classes. No matter how much I expressed my excitement or practiced for interviews, I still received the email with subject line "Thank you for applying to XYZ" and started with "Unfortunately, ...". The entire year was a reality shock.
				<br><br>
				Most of my friends had their acts together, or so it seemed. They knew what they wanted to do, and how to achieve it. They would ace midterms and have fun. And I wasn't. I was discouraged.
				<br><br>
				As an intended double major, I felt (and still feel) double the pressure. I would see my friends excel in business OR computer science. Not both. I was stuck in mediocrity. I didn't know which path to pursue, or how to combine the two.
				<br><br>
				I continued to struggle in academics in sophomore year. I took the most difficult major prerequisites in the fall. I applied to Haas (the business major). My GPA plummeted. Haas rejected me. And I continued to compare myself to my friends (and enemies) who did get in. I thought I was better than a lot of them.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3>The Solutions</h3>
				<p>
				The summer came around, and my motivation was at an all time low. I was looking to escape my relentless comparisons. I started reading again. My roommate had a large bookshelf stacked with self-help books. I picked one. <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> by Stephen Covey. And so my life changed for the better.
				</p>
				<div class="pull-right">

				</div>
				<br><br>
				<p>
				I had always approached the world with a scarcity mentality - my peers and I were competing for the same, limited resources. I learned to reframe my mindset. I wholeheartedly agree with the abundance mentality - we are actually individually pursuing a bountiful treasure trove of resources. There is enough for everyone. I'm not competing with anyone else.
				<br><br>
				Time continued to heal my wounded ego and self-esteem. I took a large step away from social media to stop comparing myself to others. I made peace with my position in life. I started to compare myself to only one person - myself from the previous day. I only worked to get better. Not to compete with or impress anyone. I started living life on my own terms.
				<br><br>
				And so, even as I struggle to find an internship for the summer, I have big plans. I have side projects to accomplish - teach myself new programming languages, cultivate a following on Quora and Medium, and recruit early for a full-time job. As long as I grow every day and take small but consistent steps toward my goals and aspirations, I am content. I can drive myself further. I define my own success.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3>The Art</h3>
				<p>
				I was very unsure about what to do for this piece. Reading literally brought me back from my personal hell. I decided to...

			<!--This section is for PHYSICAL HEALTH-->
			<div id="physical-container" style="display: none">
				
				<h3>The Roots</h3>
				<p>
				From elementary school until high school graduation, I was surrounded by students who were objectively in better physical shape than I. I have a vivid 6th-grade memory being made fun of at the end-of-the-year pool party because I was chubby. In middle school (7th and 8th grade), children reach the peak of verbal and physical hostility in their student lives. Physical education class required us to change into uniforms daily, and had a mandated swimming unit. Once again, I would be bullied.
				<br><br>
				I joined my high school Cross Country team in sophomore year. I was one of the slowest, if not <em>the</em> slowest, runner on the sophomore team. It was common for my team to know all our runners had finished the race when I crossed the line. 
				</p>
				<div class="text-center">
					<img src="images/fears/XC-results.png" height="90%" width="90%" />
				</div>
				<p>
				I ran relatively good times (how many of us can average a sub-7 minutes per mile pace over 3 miles?) and received support from my team, my coach, my parents, and everyone who knew me. If someone poked fun at me for being slow, it was all in good humor, and I understood that. But that wasn't enough for me.
				<br><br>
				The self-depreciation kicked in when I would compare myself to my friends and teammates who ran sub-17 races. I would just feel bad and angry at myself that I couldn't be just a little bit faster and run a sub-20 race.
				<br><br>
				I sat out XC season in junior year due to injury - I ran 10 miles after having not run for several months, and severely screwed up my knee. My dad bought me a gym membership.
				<br><br>
				Once again, I was surrounded by insanely buff people. Once again, I would compare myself to them. Once again, I would swell with anger and frustration that I couldn't lift as much as the student athletes or even the middle-aged parents.
				<br><br>
				I finally stopped comparing myself physically to others in college. Instead, I was simply unhappy about the way I looked. I believed that girls would like me only if I had a six-pack. With that mindset and a combination of bad-tasting food in the dining halls and fear of the "freshman 15," I would starve myself and binge-eat at random. I ended my first year physically exhausted and 5 (fat) pounds heavier than when I entered college.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3>The Solutions</h3>
				<p>
				I moved into an apartment the summer after freshman year, and things started looking up. I followed a strict 3 days a week workout regimen - Ice Cream Fitness - over the summer. I shopped for and cooked nutritious food. I ended the summer looking and feeling better than ever, but still not completely happy with my appearance.
				<br><br>
				I maintained my appearance sophomore year, but ended it wanting more out of myself. The summer saw me work out 6 days a week on a new regimen - PHUL. Once again, I ended the summer looking and feeling better than ever. But once again, not completely happy with my appearance.
				<br><br>
				I read my way out. Almost every day I had worked out that summer, I would see the same few fellow gym-goers. I built up the courage to ask a buff one about his workout lifestyle. He recommended a book -- Michael Matthews' <i>Bigger Leaner Stronger</i>. I read it through and through, and finally developed the willpower to work out for myself.
				<br><br>
				At the same time (beginning of junior year), I entered my first significant relationship (which ended amicably several months later). It destroyed my previous mentality that I needed a six-pack to be likable.
				<br><br>
				I started to bulk cook my food. Every Sunday, I spent around 3 hours preparing 10 meals for the entire week in order to save time, and watch my diet very closely.
				<br><br>
				And so I have reached a point where I'm only working out for myself. I have fitness goals that motivate me to wake up early every morning. I still try to bulk cook weekly, but I don't scrutinize every meal. Eve

				<p>My main dishes are veggie burgers, salmon, shrimp, potstickers, and tofu, with sides of quiona, lentils, string beans, broccoli, mixed veggies, spinach with black beans. I cook eggs and meat a couple times per week.</p>

				<h3>The Roots</h3>
				<p>
				My physical appearance was always something I knew I could address by simply working out more and watching my diet. I could literally see the differences between myself and others, and I could take action to improve myself.
				<br><br>
				I remember a series of three days in senior year of high school where I turned myself off. I didn't feel any emotions. I talked to my family and friends only when I was prompted to respond. I just couldn't feel anything. I don't even remember thinking. Later that year, I was rejected from a few colleges in another set of three days. Once again, I stopped thinking, feeling, and talking.
				<br><br> 
				I thought that was normal. I believed everyone went through the same mental struggles I did, and so I figured these problems would resolve themselves over time. I neglected my mental health outright until I began junior year of college because I knew I needed a big change if I wanted to succeed academically, socially, and professionally. But sometimes I still struggle to come to terms completely with the importance of my mental health.
				<br><br>
				When I feel stress, it is as though there is an iron hand clenched around my brain, pulsating with my heartbeat. I feel powerless. I turn off my brain and my feelings until I can just go through the motions to finish my obligations. 
				<br><br>
				My mental health is rooted in my perception of success in several areas: academics, physical health, friendships, relationships, family life, and even events out of my control completely (sports and politics). If I struggle in one field, the the iron grip strengthens as my struggle cascades into the other areas.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3>The Solutions</h3>
				<p>
				Working out could only alleviate so much stress. I could clear my mind and forget my external problems at the gym. But I reached a point where my thoughts flooded and pervaded my sacred gym time.
				<br><br>
				Once again, I read my way out. I found amazing people on Medium who struggled with their mental health. They found a way out. I learned from them. Over spring break (a few weeks ago), I gave up on a lot. I stopped following sports and politics. I renounced Netflix. I relinquished social media, deleting Reddit and Snapchat altogether, and removing Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn from my phone. 
				<br><br>
				I start my day with five minutes of gratitude for 3 different entities: (1) an object, (2) a person, and (3) a part of myself. For example, today (4/23/17) morning I felt gratitude for (1) my headphones, for enabling me to feel music on a deeper level and tune out distractions, (2) my sister, for participating in yesterday's March for Science in Chicago and guiding me to be a better person with support and tough love, and (3) my lungs, for allowing me to breathe deeply and healthily. There are always people in worse situations than mine. There are people who cannot afford food or shelter, let alone quality headphones. There are people who do not have a support system. There are people who require machines to breathe. This exercise is meant for me to appreciate all I have and not take anything for granted.
				<br><br>
				I resort to yoga when I need to get my mind off everything. I follow along with YouTube videos of Tim Senesi. It gives me a positive opportunity to relax, breathe, and relieve my stress.
				<br><br>
				Every night, I type out the day's events and my thoughts into a spreadsheet. I write about what went well and what did not. It's a method for me to destress without feeling obligated to talk to anyone about it. I can also go back and analyze (good and bad) mental thought patterns. I then put on my headphones and fall asleep to guided mindful meditation.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>

				<h3>The Roots</h3>
				<p>
				In middle school, I read a ridiculous article about a study that found women were more attracted to men who showed less emotion - they found pictures of men with straight faces more attractive than pictures of the same men smiling. I took that article to heart - I smiled less and less often, even when I was happy. I think after a while, keeping a straight face quashed my actual happiness.
				<br><br>
				Furthermore, I believed I had anger issues in high school. I would often find myself full of disdain at a few classmates, my sister, or even my parents. I tried to express my thoughts to my friends, but they would look at me weird or change the topic. I stopped talking about it. I kept it bottled up. I knew in my heart I didn't want to act upon the dark thoughts that occupied my mind, but I couldn't keep out the thoughts. 
				<br><br>
				College was a fresh start. I didn't know anyone, and so I couldn't resent them. I found people whose company I truly enjoyed. The dark thoughts subsided, but the emotions did not come to surface. A friend never lets me forget that he thought I was a robot for the entire first year. I remained emotionally withdrawn for my first two years of college. Of course I could show and feel emotions, sometimes very intensely, but my "regular" emotion was neutral and detached from the world.
				<br><br>
				I didn't want to show anger because I didn't want the dark thoughts to reappear. I practiced passive aggression because I feared I would explode in a tirade if I opened my mouth to express myself. I didn't want to scare anyone, especially myself. And so in repressing my anger, I repressed my other emotions inadvertently.
				<br><br>
				I reached a point where I wasn't sure I could even feel anything. I would go out of my way to watch morbid videos because I wanted to know that I could still <em>feel</em> something.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3>The Solutions</h3>
				<p>
				I didn't want to keep living life as I was. I simply couldn't. But I didn't want to turn to professional help, or admit to anyone that my problems were more serious than they appeared.
				<br><br>
				As I wrote out my thoughts to alleviate mental stress, I also wrung out my emotions on that spreadsheet. I wrote out everything I felt, leaving nothing in my head. I found myself capable to acknowledge any anger issues. I could pick and choose which emotions and intents on that spreadsheet I wanted to express vocally in hopes of a positive outcome.
				<br><br>
				And it worked in every scenario. In tandem with mindful exercises and self-help books and articles, I began to allow myself to become truly angry in very few situations. There was no point in me taking everything so seriously and to heart. I actively try to nip any negative emotions right in the bud by addressing them immediately on paper or in person.
				<br><br>
				It's still a work in progress, however. I don't want to let the anger and resentment build, because it then blocks out my ability to feel anything but those two. At the same time, I don't want to express myself immediately on something that I can let blow over and not affect me. It's all about finding a balance in deciding which issues to address and which to not.
				<br><br>
				I don't allow the dark thoughts to return. My immediate reaction to anything remotely dark is to begin writing. And quite honestly, <strong>I've never felt happier in my life</strong>. Of course times are tough, academic and professional life is stressful, and relationships are hard to maintain. There are times I find myself lost in my mind. But I'm <em>feeling</em>. Everything.
				<br><br>
				I'm full of optimism, and I have a positive outlook on my life. I find motivation in music, role models, reading and writing. I draw my energy from my potential to help people, especially those going through situations similar to mine. I have big dreams. I have plans to do everything I can to achieve them.
				<br><br>
				The only thing that can stop me is myself. <strong>If I keep my heart, my mind, and my self aligned, I can do anything</strong>.  
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3>The Art</h3>
				<p>Josh Osho's music album <i>L.I.F.E.</i> is a work of art I have never shared. I listen to it when I bulk cook, when I'm feeling down and need a pick-me-up, and for inspiration. Osho's powerful yet soothing voice fills me with resilience to put my head down and keep going.</p>
